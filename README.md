# Stochastic RSI

The Stochastic RSI (StochRSI) is an indicator used in technical analysis that ranges between zero and one (or zero and 100 on some charting platforms) and is created by applying the Stochastic oscillator formula to a set of relative strength index (RSI) values rather than to standard price data.

Relative strength index (RSI) and stochastic oscillator are both price momentum oscillators that are used to forecast market trends. Despite their similar objectives, the two indicators have very different underlying theories and methods. The stochastic oscillator is predicated on the assumption that closing prices should close near the same direction as the current trend. RSI tracks overbought and oversold levels by measuring the velocity of price movements. More analysts use RSI over the stochastic oscillator, but both are well-known and reputable technical indicators

While relative strength index was designed to measure the speed of price movements, the stochastic oscillator formula works best when the market is trading in consistent ranges. Generally speaking, RSI is more useful in trending markets, and stochastics are more useful in sideways or choppy markets.
